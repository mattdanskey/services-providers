* [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) for code highlighting
* [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) for compiling sass and bundling with livereload-like capabilities while developing
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) because it is awesomeness
* [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) so that vendor prefixes don't have to be worried about
